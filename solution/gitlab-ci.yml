# Declare four stages for our pipeline.
# deploy:test - Used to deploy our configuration to the test infrastructure
# test:fabric - Used to test that the VLAN fabric is sane
# test:connectivity - Used to test that we have L3 connectivity in our fabric
# deploy:prod - Used to deploy our tested config into production
stages:
  - deploy:test
  - test:fabric
  - test:connectivity
  - deploy:prod

# The first command installs all the necessary Python packages.
# The second command removes the world-writeable bit from the ansible subdirectory
